Shiny project deployment [link](https://jvichare.shinyapps.io/musicPopularity/).

**Sidenote**: if the shinyapps.io app deployment is offline, I apologize. To run the app otherwise, I have included all the files in the `musicPopularity` folder, or you can read more about my app on the [NYC Data Science Academy blog post](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/analyzing-spotify-song-metrics-to-visualize-popular-songs/).
